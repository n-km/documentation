# Raspberry Pi 5

## Switch from CasaOS to another OS

## Why?
- CasaOS on Raspi5 - "Failed to load apps, please refresh later."
- That was an issue by my side... - Don't talk about that. 
- Let's talk about how to setting UmbrelOS up.

### First Steps
- Safe any data. 
- Install umbrelos-pi5.img.zip - extract them
- Wait, Wait and Wait...

### Flashing OS on MicroSD
- Failed.
- Currently looking for another OS

### Using DietPi
- Successfully
- installing immich via docker
- get interesting of how to backup data how and where

#### First Solution
- cronjobs (That's the part where I'am looking for currently.)

#### Upload images via using the cli
